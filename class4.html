<h3>Dealing with a merge conflict</h3>
<p>I've set up the Moby Dick project on GitHub. It has two branches, and I have set up the files that they will give you a merge conflict when you try to merge them to give you practice. Try to clone and bring down the additional branch on your own, but if you need help, see the instructions below:</p>

<h4>Bring down the branches</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clone this repository: <a href="https://github.com/katebron/Moby_dick">https://github.com/katebron/Moby_dick</a></li>
<li>Run git branch -a to see all the branches</li>
<li>To automatically set up a new branch and pull my additional GitHub branch into it, run</li>
<div class="example">
git checkout another_moby
</div>
<li>Run git diff to see the differences betwen the two branches</li>
</ol>

<h4>Merge the branches</h3>
<p>In this exercise, I'd like you to merge another_moby into master. Try to do this part on your own - feel free to Google. I will have 'solutions' next week.
<ul>
<li>Move to master</li>
<li>Merge another_moby into master</li>
<li>Deal with the merge conflict</li>
</ul>
